# Accounting Planner

|**Title:**|Python Optimization Problem using PULP Optimization on  Jupyter Notebook|
|---|---|
|||
|**Context:**|This project is for an accounting budgeting and planning tool. The objective is to optimise given input parameters to **maximise** the target value while adhering to the specified constraints. This process is currently being done manually on Excel through trial and error and could be best accelerated if it was optimised by a python model.|
|**Problem & Input Variables:**|A. For every iteration of Anchor Parameter 5 (I.e. Parameter 5 is an integer iterating from 90 to 1,000) - This means that Anchor parameter will be externally inputted as 90 or 91 or 150 etc<br>B. The optimisation model must find and save the best values for the following  Input Variables:<br><br>Input 10: An integer from 3 to 18 (Both 3 and 18 included)<br>Input 11: An integer from 25 to 50 (Both 25 and 50 included)<br>Input 12: An integer from 50 to 100 (Both 50 and 100 included)<br>Input 13: A 2 decimal float from 0.26 to 0.40 (Both 0.26 and 0.40 included)<br>Input 14: A 2 decimal float from 0.44 to 0.69 (Both 0.44 and 0.69 included)<br>Input 15: A 2 decimal float from 0.70 to 0.90 (Both 0.70 and 0.90 included)|
